# Multiplayer Testing Guide

## 🎮 **Multiplayer Networking Successfully Implemented!**

Real-time multiplayer functionality has been added to the Super Smash Bros Clone using Socket.io networking.

---

## 🚀 **How to Test Multiplayer**

### **1. Start the Server**
```bash
npm start
```
The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`

### **2. Test the Networking Infrastructure**
Open the test page in your browser:
```
http://localhost:3000/test_multiplayer.html
```

This test page allows you to:
- ✅ Connect to the Socket.io server
- ✅ Join a room with character selection
- ✅ Send test input data
- ✅ View real-time game state updates
- ✅ Monitor connection logs

### **3. Test Full Multiplayer Gameplay**

#### **Option A: Single Browser (Different Tabs)**
1. Open `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click "Online Multiplayer"
3. Select a character and start
4. Open another tab to `http://localhost:3000`
5. Repeat steps 2-3 with a different character

#### **Option B: Different Browsers/Devices**
1. Connect multiple browsers/devices to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Each player selects "Online Multiplayer"
3. Choose characters and play!

## 🔍 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Networking Architecture**
```javascript
Client → Socket.io → Server → GameRoom → Physics → Broadcast → All Clients
```

### **Character Selection Flow**
1. Client selects character in CharacterSelectScene
2. Character data sent to server via `joinRoom` event
3. Server creates player with character-specific properties
4. Game state synchronized across all clients

### **Real-time Updates**
- **60 FPS** server tick rate
- **Game state** broadcast to all players
- **Input validation** on server
- **Position synchronization** across clients

---

## 🐛 **Known Issues & Limitations**

### **Current Limitations**
- ⚠️ **Room Capacity**: Max 4 players per room
- ⚠️ **Character Sprites**: Some characters may not render properly in multiplayer
- ⚠️ **Lag Compensation**: Basic implementation, could be improved
- ⚠️ **Reconnection**: Limited reconnection handling

### **Testing Notes**
- Test with multiple browsers for best results
- Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
- Server logs show connection and room activity
- Use the test page to debug networking issues

---

## 📊 **Performance Monitoring**

### **Server Performance**
- Monitor server console for connection logs
- Check for memory leaks with multiple connections
- Verify 60 FPS game loop performance

### **Client Performance**
- Check browser network tab for WebSocket activity
- Monitor for dropped frames or lag
- Test with different network conditions
