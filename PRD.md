## Game Mechanics

### Controls
- **Movement**: Arrow keys or WASD
- **Jump**: Spacebar
- **Attack**: Z key
- **Block**: X key
- **Special**: C key (Phase 3)

### Combat System
- **Health**: 0-999% damage system (like Smash Bros)
- **Knockback**: Increases with damage percentage
- **Lives**: 3 stock per player
- **Victory**: Last player standing

### Stage Design
- **Platforms**: Main platform + 2-3 smaller platforms
- **Boundaries**: Players die when knocked off screen
- **Stage Hazards**: None in Phase 1-2, optional in Phase 3

## Multiplayer Requirements

### Network Architecture
- **Server**: Authoritative for game state
- **Client**: Predictive movement for responsiveness
- **Sync Rate**: 60 FPS server updates
- **Interpolation**: Smooth movement between updates

### Room System
- **Capacity**: 2-4 players per room
- **Matchmaking**: Simple join/create room system
- **Reconnection**: Basic reconnection handling

## Performance Requirements
- **Latency**: <100ms for responsive gameplay
- **Frame Rate**: 60 FPS on client
- **Concurrent Players**: Support for 10+ concurrent rooms
- **Memory**: <50MB client-side

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success
- [✅] 2 players can move around a stage
- [✅] Basic collision detection works
- [✅] Multiplayer synchronization functional (local)
- [✅] No major bugs in core systems

### Phase 2 Success
- [-] 4 players can fight simultaneously - Currently 2-player local only
- [✅] Combat feels responsive and fair
- [✅] Health/damage system works correctly
- [✅] Games have clear win conditions

### Phase 3 Success

- **Performance Issues**: Profile early and often
- **Physics Synchronization**: Use proven patterns from game dev community

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to core features first
- **Technical Debt**: Refactor during Phase 3
- **Asset Creation**: Use placeholders until Phase 3

## Deployment Strategy
- **Development**: Local development server
- **Testing**: Heroku or Railway for server, Netlify for client
- **Production**: Same as testing for MVP

## Post-Launch Considerations
- Player feedback integration
- Additional characters/stages
