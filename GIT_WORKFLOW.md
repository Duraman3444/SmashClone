## Usage Commands

### Regular Development (Main)
```bash
# Switch to main (if not already there)
git checkout main

# Add and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"

# Push to main (when remote is set up)
git push origin main
```

### Demo Updates (Only when requested)
```bash
# Switch to demo
git checkout demo

# Merge from main
git merge main

# Push to demo (when remote is set up)
git push origin demo
```

## Remote Repository Setup (Next Steps)

When ready to push to a remote repository:

1. Create repository on GitHub/GitLab
2. Add remote origin:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin <repository-url>
   ```
3. Push both branches:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   git push -u origin demo
   ```

## Notes

- Both branches currently contain identical code
- All future development will happen on **main**
- Demo branch will only be updated when user requests it
- This ensures demo always contains stable, tested versions
